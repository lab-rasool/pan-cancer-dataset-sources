# Pan-Cancer Datasets

Collection of pan-cancer datasets consisting of various modalities, including medical and clinical records, radiology (CT, MRIs, PET), pathology (H&E and IHC), and omics data (genomics and proteomics) have been compiled below. This is a non-exhaustive collection that is being updated periodically. The purpose of this compilation is to provide the cancer research community with a unified view of the resources available for studying various cancer sites, organs, and modalities. We aim to utilize these resources in our ongoing research and fight against the cancer disease.

Primarily, we have compiled the list of datasets from data portals under the flagship of **NIH National Cancer Institute** ([NCI](https://www.cancer.gov/)) that include, **The Cancer Imaging Archive** ([TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)), **Genomic Data Commons** ([GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)) portal of **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, and **Proteomic Data Commons** ([PDC](http://proteomic.datacommons.cancer.gov/pdc)) portal of **Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)**. Below is the summary of the datasets available at these portals.

- Study of molecular characterization of over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 34 cancer types.
- Joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute.
- Over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data.
- Publicly available for research use.
- Genomics data available at the **Genomics Data Commons** portal, [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.data_format%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22svs%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D), open access.
- Imaging data available at **The Cancer Imaging Archive** ([TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)), open access. The radiology and  histopathology data of TCIA can be accessed and downloaded through the following portals:
  - **TCIA** [Radiology](https://public-dev.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/) data portal.
  - **TCIA** [Histopathology](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/histopathology-imaging-on-tcia/) data portal.
- Proteomics data is available through the **Proteomic Data Commons** ([PDC](http://proteomic.datacommons.cancer.gov/pdc)) under the **Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)** program.

Below we first present the **National Cancer Institute** ([NCI](https://www.cancer.gov/)) data modalities followed by the 32 cancer types and their corresponding datasets, primary publications, number of cases, and modalities. The list is organized by cancer type and then by data modality. The data modalities include clinical, copy number, DNA, imaging, and miRNA, mRNA, and protein expression. The second table below presents the non-NCI dataset resources available for public access. Lastly, we present the list of abbreviations for the cancer study name used in this compilation.
